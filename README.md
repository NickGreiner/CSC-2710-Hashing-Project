# The Assignment

Hash functions and hash tables are one of the most powerful tools in computer science. When well implemented, they can take a complex large search space and reduce its complexity by a huge factor and in many cases even to O(1). I would like for you to work together in teams of three to apply hash-based techniques to creating a solution to problem you choose. At the most basic level this could consist of a simple system that improves the speed of finding a simple record in a set of data. There are certainly much more interesting applications available. In class we discussed how the technology can be applied to ensure the integrity of a sent message and dramatically speed the performance of spell checkers. A simple Internet search will yield a vast range of problem spaces where these techniques have proved effective.

An ideal project would be one that would take some real world problem space and creatively use hashbased techniques to solve the problem or improve performance. The more interesting problem you choose the more you will get out of the assignment. 

# Team Based Work

Working in teams is the norm in almost all work environments. Part of the assignment will be managing the strengths and weaknesses that are going to be part of any team. At the end of the project, each team member will be asked to anonymously assign each of their team members a rating and review. This peer review will be a portion of each student’s final grade for the project.

# Presenting the Work

Another aspect of programing that will be encountered in a work environment is the need to present work and programmatic solutions to complex problems to supervisors and peers. Often times the main visibility you will have to high level supervisors where you work is when you are presenting a project you have completed. This is a chance for you to shine and get noticed for career advancement. Being an effective presenter is also an important skill when multiple teams need to coordinate. 

Each team member will be responsible for presenting a portion of the project. The presentations will require three parts with one of the three team members being responsible for each of the three parts.

# At a minumum, your presentation should include these three sections

1.) A description of the problem space that the team chose to explore. This presentation will include describing the hash-based approach the team took to try and solve the problem.

2.) A presentation and walkthrough of the code that was written by the team.

3.) A final analysis of the success of the team’s approach and solution. If the team’s program failed why did it do so. In computer science, it is quite normal for an attempted solution to fail to fully achieved the targeted goals. Some of the most successful software ever created has been built on the foundation of a few previous failed attempts where teams tried a solution and failed, but they gained valuable knowledge into why a certain approach will not work.

# Written Report

The final portion of this assignment will be a brief written report of your team’s work that will describe and analyze material similar to what was presented in the team’s presentations. One to two pages will be sufficient, but there is no limit. Again, this is a very important skill for all of you to develop. Often times hugely important decisions such as whether you are given a large project or whether your current project is cancelled will hinge entirely on the final decision that is made by a division head, where the only contact you will have is through a report you have written.

# Project Due Date

Your work will be due at the start of class on November 23, and your presentations will be given in class that day.
